This is the repository for **Hector**, an open source, object-oriented, simple global climate carbon-cycle model. It model runs essentially instantaneously while still representing the most critical global scale earth system processes, and is one of a class of models heavily used for for complex climate model emulation and uncertainty analyses. For example, Hector's global temperature rise for the RCP 8.5 scenario, compared to observations and other model results, looks like this:

The Hector primary source of model documentation is the Github [wiki](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/wiki). The code is also well documented with [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org)-style comments.

The Hector model description paper is [here](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/7/7075/2014/gmdd-7-7075-2014.html).
